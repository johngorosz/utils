The goal is to recieve automatic monthly emails from NSTAR with account numbers 
and amount due, parse/filter the emails, store the data for easy display and 
send an email of rent due.

=================

email.php

For some unexplained reason, bluehost can only pipe emails to a php file.  So,
this file only parses STDIN and redirects to one of the file names:

  gas_1
  electric_1
  gas_2
  electric_2
  electric_3

=================

util_parse.sh

This script will parse the 4 files produced monthly and add them to the main
database file - murdock.csv.  This consolidated file will allow for easy 
use of the data for historic purposes, like:

  - plotting yearly data for comparison
  - calculating and sending automatic emails

=================

create_email.sh

This script will use the murdock.csv database file to create 2 emails with
the monthly utils plus rent.  The email file names take the form of 
<month>_<number>, e.g. Feb_1 for unit #1's February bill (January utilities
and February rent).

=================

email_utils.sh

This script will send the 2 emails compiled from the monthly data.
